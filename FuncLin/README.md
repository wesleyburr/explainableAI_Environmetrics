# explainableAI_Environmetrics
Folder containing code and data for the functional linear model

code for the model is in the func_lm_code Folder

stat_model_eda.R -- plots the US Corn Belt locations and the marginal correlations of the soil moisture data in the cornbelt with 3-month lagged SST

stat_model_all.R -- conducts all the remaining analysis including generating persistence model fits, running the functional linear model and generating all tables and plots, and obtaining model reliance metrics for the stat_model_all

modelreliance.Rdata -- saved R object containing the modelreliance metrics for the functional linear model (this is saved as obtaning the metrics can be time-consuming)
